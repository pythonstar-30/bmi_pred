The project aims to process and analyze mugshot images from
the IDOC mugshots dataset to:
1. Extract image features using Opencv
2. Predict Body Mass Index (BMI) and gender from the features
using Random forest regressor and classifier
3. Evaluate the model&#39;s performance using metrics like Mean
Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² score, and accuracy.
